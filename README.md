My version of the application featured in CodeMaze's Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API Premium Second Edition tutorial.
It is a .NET Core 6.0 Web API project with numerous advanced features.

To run this application you will first need to install SQL Server and run the migrations in the Migrations folder
in the main project, while updating the database with the 'Update-Database' command in the PM Console in  Visual Studio.
