My version of the application featured in CodeMaze's Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API Premium Second Edition tutorial.
It is a .NET Core 8.0 Web API project with numerous advanced features. I upgraded the project from .NET 6.0 and changed many libraries which were depricated or not supported anymore. Spezialliy asp.versioning was new.

To run this application you will first need to install SQL Server and update the database with the 'Update-Database' command in the PM Console in  Visual Studio.
